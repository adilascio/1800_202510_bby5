## Limitations and Future Work
### Limitations

- The current MVP focuses on core features like workout logging and event creation; some social features (e.g., home feed, followers/following system) remain unimplemented.
- Certain UI elements, particularly on event and home pages, are in early stages and could benefit from further refinement.

### Future Work

- **Enhanced Social Features**: Implement a home feed and follower system to deepen community interactions.
- **Expanded Analytics**: Introduce additional metrics and visualizations to better track fitness progress.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Continue refining the user interface for enhanced usability and accessibility, including potential dark mode support.
